# Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA

## Description
This project focuses on time series forecasting using the ARIMA model, specifically applied to the Jena climate dataset. The main components include data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation Instructions
To set up the environment and install dependencies, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the main script, execute:
```
python main.py
```

## Data
The dataset used in this project is the Jena climate dataset. It can be downloaded automatically by the script if it doesn't exist in the specified path.

## Model
This project utilizes the ARIMA model for time series forecasting. The model is trained on the temperature data from the Jena climate dataset.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric.
